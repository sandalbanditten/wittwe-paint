# Wittwe paint

A little paint program in C99 and SDL.
Made so i can do verbal math assignments using a graphic tablet.

This is version 0.1

Some of the code in this program was taken from whine, a white noise generator.
A fork of whine is on my GitHub.

## TODO:
* Be able to export as png
* Exit icon
* Use SDL point in rec
* Move function groups to seperate files
